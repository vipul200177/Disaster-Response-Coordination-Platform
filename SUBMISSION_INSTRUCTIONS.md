## AI-Assisted Development
This project was developed using Cursor AI, which provided assistance with:

### **Backend Development**
- Generated Express.js server structure with middleware
- Created comprehensive API routes (50+ endpoints)
- Implemented authentication and authorization middleware
- Generated Supabase service integration with caching
- Created external service integrations (Gemini AI, Geocoding, Social Media)

### **Frontend Development**
- Generated React components and context providers
- Created real-time WebSocket integration
- Implemented user authentication and role-based access
- Generated responsive CSS styling

### **Database Design**
- Generated comprehensive Supabase schema with geospatial support
- Created indexes and row-level security policies
- Generated sample data and audit trail functionality

### **Documentation**
- Generated comprehensive README with API documentation
- Created deployment guides for multiple platforms
- Generated setup instructions and troubleshooting guides

### **Key AI-Generated Features**
- Mock data generation for testing without external dependencies
- Real-time social media simulation with priority alert classification
- Geocoding service with multiple provider fallbacks
- AI-powered location extraction and image verification
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## ðŸ“§ **Email Template**

**Subject**: Disaster Response Coordination Platform - Assignment Submission

**Body**:
```
Dear [Instructor Name],

I am submitting my Disaster Response Coordination Platform assignment.

**GitHub Repository**: 
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/disaster-response-coordination-platform

**Live Demo URLs**:
- Frontend (Vercel): https://disaster-response-platform.vercel.app
- Backend (Render): https://disaster-response-backend.onrender.com

**Features Implemented**:
âœ… MERN stack backend with Express.js and comprehensive API
âœ… React frontend with real-time WebSocket updates
âœ… Supabase integration for data storage and geospatial queries
âœ… Google Gemini AI integration for location extraction and image verification
âœ… Social media integration (Twitter/Bluesky) with priority alert classification
âœ… Geocoding services (Google Maps, Mapbox, OpenStreetMap)
âœ… Role-based authentication and authorization
âœ… Real-time disaster tracking and resource management
âœ… 50+ API endpoints with comprehensive documentation
âœ… Mock data for testing without external dependencies
âœ… Production-ready deployment configurations

**Technical Stack**:
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, Winston logging
- Frontend: React, Socket.io-client, Axios, React Hot Toast
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL with geospatial extensions)
- AI: Google Gemini API
- Maps: Google Maps API, Mapbox, OpenStreetMap
- Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Render (backend)

**Cursor/Windsurf Usage**: 
The project was developed with significant assistance from Cursor AI, which generated boilerplate code, implemented complex features like real-time updates and AI integrations, and provided comprehensive documentation. Details are included in the CURSOR_USAGE.md file in the zip submission.

**Testing Instructions**:
1. Visit the live demo URL
2. Login with any of the mock users (netrunnerX, reliefAdmin, fieldWorker, volunteer, citizen1)
3. Test real-time features by opening multiple browser tabs
